# 2GIS Review Scraper & Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview

This project is designed to scrape business reviews from the 2gis.kz platform, process the collected text data, and then train a sentiment analysis model to classify the reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.

## Data Sources

1.  **Target Website for Scraping**: `2gis.kz` (specifically, business review pages). The URL for the target business is specified in `scrap.ipynb`.
2.  **Scraped Data (`reviews_data.csv`)**:
    * Generated by `scrap.ipynb`.
    * Contains columns for "Review" text and "Stars".
    * This file is then processed to add a "label" column.
3.  **Emoji Data Files (`emojiData/1.csv`, `emojiData/2.csv`, `emojiData/3.csv`)**:
    * Used by `textClassifier.ipynb` to map emojis to their textual descriptions.
    * They are merged into a single emoji reference dataset (`all.csv` - an intermediate file).
4.  **Merged Reviews (`Reviews/Reviews.csv`)**:
    * `textClassifier.ipynb` can merge multiple CSV files from a `Reviews/` directory. If `reviews_data.csv` (from scraping) is the primary source, it should be placed in this directory.
    * This merged file is the main input for the text classifier.

## Workflow

1.  **Scraping (Selenium):**
    * Update under your usage(mine is draft) 
2.  **Data Preparation for ML:**
    * Combines review datasets(we scrapped with group).
    * Converts star ratings to sentiment labels (e.g., >3 stars = positive, 3 = neutral, <3 = negative).
    * **Emoji Handling:** Crucial for text normalization; emojis are replaced by descriptive text (e.g., "❤️" -> " red_heart ").
    * **Text Vectorization:** Reviews are tokenized, and a vocabulary is built. Words are converted to numerical IDs. Sequences are padded to ensure uniform length for model input.
3.  **RNN Model (PyTorch):**
    * **Embedding Layer:** Converts numerical word IDs into dense vector representations.
    * **RNN Layer:** Processes the sequence of word embeddings to capture contextual information. The notebook uses `nn.RNN`.
    * **Dropout Layer:** For regularization to prevent overfitting.
    * **Fully Connected Layer (Linear):** Maps the RNN's hidden state to the output sentiment classes.
4.  **Training & Evaluation:**
    * Uses CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer.
    * Used 20 epochs.
    * Evaluates performance using accuracy on a held-out test set.
